				Convert To LF Readme
				--------------------

What is it?
----------
	
	ConvertToLF is a filter that removes the carriage returns used in the
	end of file markers on some operating systems. BeOS uses just a line
	feed to mark the end of line, and gcc, the BeOS compiler and StyledEdit
	don't function properly with carriage returns in source code / text files.

Installation
------------

	To install this tracker add on you need to put a copy or link in the 
	"home/config/add-ons/Tracker" directory. I've included a shortcut in
	the distribution to make this easy... just drop a copy into the shortcut
	labelled: "Drop in here to install".

Usage
-----

	To use on a text file, select that file in the tracker, right click, go
	to the menu that says "Add-Ons" and select "ConvertToLF". The add-on will
	then remove all the "CR" chars in the file and return without putting up
	any user interface.
	
	Be warned that running "ConvertToLF" on a file that isn't text will destroy
	it, especially executable code. So be careful ok, don't come complaining
	to me that it screwed up some file. Thats your responsibility to use it
	correctly.
